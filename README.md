    * Description:
    *             - This project is a library developed in Matlab to calculate the 
                    Minimal Cycle Basis of a Graph.
                  - The graph is imported from a text file containing in the first two lines 
                    the number of nodes and vertices and in the following lines one edge 
                    featuring: sourceVertex destinationVertex weight
                  - The library include the calculation of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
                  - A custom plot function has been included to display the graph and the MST
